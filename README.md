1.What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In both Project One and Project Two, our main objective was to tackle issues concerning algorithmic design and data structures. In Project One, our task was to enhance a program for ABC University by creating pseudocode. The challenge we faced here was to come up with an algorithm that would cater to the specific requirements of the university. Moving on to Project 2, we took it up a notch by not only creating pseudocode but also implementing actual code to develop software for the university. This involved translating our designs into fully functional and efficient programs.


2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To tackle these problems effectively, I adopted an organized approach. My first step was to comprehend the problem statements, breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Additionally, I carefully considered the selection of data structures that would best suit the task at hand. The choice of data structures is crucial, as it directly affects how efficiently we can store, retrieve, and manipulate data. For instance, making the decision between arrays, linked lists, or trees can significantly impact the performance of an algorithm. Hence, my focus was on selecting data structures and devising algorithms with optimal time and space complexity.


3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the course, I faced obstacles and hurdles. To overcome them, I took the approach of reviewing course work and seeking clarification whenever I didn't fully grasp concepts in my ebook. Whenever I encountered coding errors or unexpected outcomes, I followed a debugging process by utilizing print statements and debugging tools to identify and resolve each issue one by one. Furthermore, it was beneficial for me to regularly review the principles of data structures and algorithms, which helped strengthen my understanding and problem-solving abilities.
 

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on these projects has really expanded my perspective on software development. Nowadays, when I design software, I tend to think algorithmically. I focus on breaking down problems into parts and coming up with efficient solutions. I've also come to realize how crucial it is to choose the data structures, as they can greatly affect the efficiency and scalability of our software. Additionally, I've become better at turning algorithmic ideas into tangible functional code.
 

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Throughout these projects, I've gained a lesson in the importance of writing clean and maintainable code. One key aspect I've learned is the significance of using variable and function names to improve code readability. Additionally, I now understand the value of documentation and comments, as they help others (including my future self) understand and modify the code. Another crucial lesson was embracing the design approach, which involves breaking down software into smaller, reusable components for adaptability and extensibility. Lastly, regular debugging and comprehensive testing have become practices to ensure reliable and robust programs.
Not only has this course deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, but it has also instilled in me a structured and efficient approach to software design and development. It has enhanced my problem-solving skills while emphasizing the importance of writing code that's not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable—all essential skills for any software developer.
